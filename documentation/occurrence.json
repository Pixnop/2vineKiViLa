Note that for technical reasons we also have a hard limit for any query of 100,000 records. You will get an error if the offset + limit exceeds 100,000. To retrieve all records beyond 100,000 you should use our asynchronous download service (below) instead.","x-Order":{"Order":"0200"}},{"name":"Occurrence downloads","description":"**For a guide to making downloads through the API, see the [guide to API downloads](/en/data-use/api-downloads).** *The documentation here is automatically generated from the Java code.  It is always up-to-date, but the structure for the main download request method is complex.*\n\nThis API provides services to request bulk downloads of occurrence records and retrieve information about those downloads.\n\nOccurrence downloads are created asynchronously \u2014 the user requests a download and, once complete, is sent an email with a link to the resulting file.\n\nIt is necessary to register as a user at [GBIF.org](https://www.gbif.org/) to create a download request, and use HTTP authentication using the username (not the email) and password.\n\n### Occurrence Download Predicates\n\nFor the API reference for download predicates expand the \u201cSchema\u201d \u2192 `predicate` section of the request body schema on the [creation API call](#Occurrence%20downloads/requestDownload) (the first one after this text).\n\n### Occurrence Download Limits\n\nOccurrence downloads demand significant computational resources, and are monitored and limited according to the GBIF platform load. In order to avoid that downloads requested by a single user utilize most of the resources two rules have been set:\n\n1. Download complexity limits:\n   * A download predicate may contain a maximum of 101,000 items (taxon keys, kingdom keys, phylum keys,      catalogue numbers, occurrence ids and so on).\n   * A download predicate may contain a maximum of 10,000 points in any \u201cwithin\u201d predicate geometries.\n2. Limits on incomplete (preparing, running) downloads:\n   * If the total number of incomplete downloads is fewer than 100, any single user can have no more than 3      incomplete downloads.\n   * If the total number of downloads is fewer than 1000 any single user may only have 1 download.\n\nThe number of user downloads currently in progress can be seen on the [System Health page](https://www.gbif.org/system-health). Your own downloads can be seen on your [My Downloads](https://www.gbif.org/user/download) page.","x-Order":{"Order":"0300"}},{"name":"Occurrence download formats","description":"This API lists the fields present in the various download formats, their data types and their term identifiers.","x-Order":{"Order":"0400"}},{"name":"Occurrence download statistics","description":"This API provides statistics about occurrence downloads.","x-Order":{"Order":"0500"}},{"name":"Occurrence metrics","description":"This API provides services to retrieve various counts and metrics provided for occurrence records.
